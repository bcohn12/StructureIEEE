#At-A-Glance Abstract
The paper discusses a method to assess the geometric
structure of the space of feasible activations of muscles in a
redundant neuromusculoskeletal system, given the task
constraints. The space of activations is sampled through
the hit-and-run algorithm in order to identify the feasible
subset of the muscle activation space. The technique is
first demonstrated in a toy problem involving two muscles
and is then applied to a more realistic situation
(isometric force generation by a model of the index
finger). The space of feasible activations is then displayed in
terms of the distribution of the activations of each
muscle.
