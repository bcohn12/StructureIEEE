\section{DISCUSSION}

Our results clearly show that\\
-The Hit-and-Run algorithm can explore the feasible activation space for a realistic 7-muscle finger in a way that is computationally tractable.\\
-For some muscles, we find that the bounding box exceptionally misconstrues the internal structure of the feasible activation set.\\
-The Hit-and-Run algorithm is cost-agnostic in the sense that no cost function is needed to predict the distribution of muscle activation patterns. Therefore, we can provide spatial context to where 'optimal' solutions lie within the solution space; this approach can be used to explore the consequences of different cost functions.\\
-The distribution of muscle activations often show and strong modes that will critically affect the learning of motor tasks.
