\section{RESULTS}

Figure \ref{fig:raw_histograms} shows the distributions of activations resulting from $1,000,000$ solutions computed with Hit-and-Run sampling. This is the first time (to our knowledge) that the internal structure of the feasible activation set has been visualized for a sub-maximal force.

Notice also that the lower and upper bounds of the activations (i.e., the dashed lines that indicate their bounding box), are uniquely uninformative of the actual density of distribution of feasible activations. Note also that the activation needed for the maximal force output (thick gray line) is very often not the mode of the activations at 50\% of output.
