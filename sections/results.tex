We produce a $$(100000,7)$$ matrix, where each row represents an activation vector lying within the FAS.
Each element of the matrix represents a muscle's activation for that given activation vector. 
 Thus, we project the high-dimensional polytope onto each of its 7 dimensions, and visualize the contribution of a given muscle across all of solutions with histogram binning. 
 Density is defined as counts/(n*diff(breaks)



Fig X. Activation distributions of 100,000 solutions sampled with the Hit and Run technique, where the task is generating 50\% of maximal force in the palmar direction.
Dotted lines represent the upper and lower bounds of activation observed in the sample, and the grey bar represents the unique activation solution at maximal force output.
