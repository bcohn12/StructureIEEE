We produce a $$(100000,7)$$ matrix, where each row represents an activation vector lying within the FAS. Each element of the matrix represents a muscle's activation for that given activation vector. Thus, we project the high-dimensional polytope onto each of its 7 dimensions, and visualize the contribution of a given muscle across all of solutions with histogram binning.
