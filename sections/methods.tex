\subsection{Hit-and-Run algorithm}
The boundaries of the convex polytope defining the feasible activation set are defined by the mechanics of the limb and the constraints of the task, as is described in Subsection \ref{ss:finger}. The goal of the Hit-and-Run algorithm is to uniformly sample a convex body \cite{smith1984efficient}. 
In the case of a schematic tendon-driven limb with three muscles, the feasible activation space is the unit cube (as muscles can only be activated positively from 0 to a maximal normalized value of 1). As explained in \cite{Valero-Cuevas2009mathematical}, when task constraints are introduced to the system, the feasible activation set is further reduced; in this context, a task is a static force vector produced at the endpoint of the limb, which is represented as a set of inequality constraints. Thus if this simple limb meets all constraints, the feasible activation set of the polygon $P$ contains all feasible activation  $\textbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ that satisfy
\[\textbf{f} = A\textbf{a}, \textbf{a} \in [0,1]^n,\]
where $\textbf{f} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is a fixed force vector, and $A = J^{-T}RF_o \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$---where $J$, $R$, and $F_o$ are the matrices of the Jacobian of the limb, the moment arms of the tendons, and the strengths of the muscles, respectively \cite{Valero-Cuevas1998Large,Valero-Cuevas2009mathematical}. $P$ is bounded by the unit $n$-cube since all variables $a_i$, $i \in [n]$ are bounded by 0 and 1 from below, above respectively.
Consider the following $1 \times 3$ fabricated example, where the task is a 1N unidimensional force.
\begin{align*}
&1 = \frac{10}{3}a_1 - \frac{53}{15}a_2 + 2a_3 \\
&a_1, a_2, a_3 \in [0,1],
\end{align*}
the set of feasible activations is given by the shaded set in Figure 1.

The Hit-and-Run walk on $P$ is defined as follows (it works analogously for any convex body). 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Inner Point: Find a given starting point $\textbf{p}$ of $P$ (Figure \ref{fig:hitruncube}a) .
\item Direction: Generate a random direction from $\textbf{p}$ (uniformly at random over all directions) (Figure \ref{fig:hitruncube}a).
\item Endpoints: Find the intersection points of the random direction with the edges of the polytope (Figure \ref{fig:hitruncube}b).
\item New Point: Pick a point uniform at random along the line segment defined by the endpoints (Figure \ref{fig:hitruncube}c). 
\item Repeat from $(a)$ the above steps with the new point as the starting point .
\end{enumerate}

To find a starting point in 
\[\textbf{f} = A\textbf{a}, \textbf{a} \in [0,1]^n,\]
we only need to find a feasible activation vector. For the Hit-and-Run algorithm to mix faster, we want the starting point to be centrally located within the polytope. We use the following standard trick with slack variables $\epsilon_i$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:LP_r}
\begin{array}{lrcl}
\mbox{maximize} & \sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \\ 
\mbox{subject to} & \textbf{f} &=& A\textbf{a}\\
  & a_i &\in& [\epsilon_i, 1- \epsilon_i], \hspace{5mm} \forall i \in \{1,\dots,n\}  \\
  & \epsilon_i &\geq& 0, \hspace{5mm} \forall i \in \{1,\dots,n\}.  
\end{array}
\end{equation}

How many points are necessary to reach a uniform distribution across the polytope?
For convex polygons in higher dimensions (over 40 dimensional), experimental results suggest that $\mathcal{O}(n)$ steps of the Hit-and-Run algorithm are sufficient. In particular Emiris and Fisikopoulos paper suggest that $(10 + \frac{10}{n})n$ steps are enough to converge upon the uniform distribution \cite{emiris2013efficient}.
In the index finger model we executed the Hit-and-Run algorithm $1,000,000$ times, selecting only every 100th point.

\subsection{Realistic index finger model}
\label{ss:finger}
We used our published model in \cite{Valero-Cuevas1998Large} to find matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 7}$, where $\textbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^7$. The seven muscles are \emph{flexor digitorum profundus} (FDP), \emph{flexor digitorum superficialis} (FDS), \emph{extensor indicis proprius} (EIP), \emph{extensor digitorum communis} (EDC), \emph{lumbrical} (LUM), \emph{dorsal interosseous} (DI), and \emph{palmar interosseous} (PI). The four degrees of freedom were ad-abduction, flexion-extension at the metacarpophalangeal joint, and flexion-extension at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. The force direction we simulated is in the palmar direction in the posture shown in Figure \ref{fig:finger}.
