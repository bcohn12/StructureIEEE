\begin{methods}
We decided to sample the FAS uniformly, in order to collect a set of feasible activation vectors which we can then investigate on a muscle-by-muscle basis. As the FAS is a 7-dimensional polytope, it cannot be visualized with one muscle per axis as a viewable solid. The 'Hit and run' appears to be a reasonable way of viewing densities of distributions across a polytope because we know it converges to the uniform distribution. We chose to sample
