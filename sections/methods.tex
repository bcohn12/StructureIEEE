In order to approximate the relative number of solutions, we must generate some representation of the volumetric structure of the FAS. Sampling uniformly from this distribution is imperative, else the true distributions will be obfuscated. Hit and run appears to be a reasonable way of viewing densities of distributions across a polytope because we know it converges to the uniform distribution. We chose
