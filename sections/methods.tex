We decided to sample the FAS uniformly, in order to collect a set of feasible activation vectors which we can then investigate on a muscle-by-muscle basis. As the FAS is a 7-dimensional polytope, it cannot be visualized with one muscle per axis as a viewable solid. In order to approximate the relative number of solutions in different areas of the polytope, we must generate some representation of the FAS volume across all of the muscle activation possibilities. is imperative. Hit and run appears to be a reasonable way of viewing densities of distributions across a polytope because we know it converges to the uniform distribution. We chose to sample
